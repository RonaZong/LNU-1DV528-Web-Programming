# Web Scraper Assignment

## Description

This project is a web scraper that automates the workflow of finding a common free day for three friends, checking available movies, and booking a table at their favorite restaurant.

## Installation

```sh
npm install

npm start https://courselab.lnu.se/scraper-site-1
```

Satisfaction and Improvements:
I am satisfied with the overall structure and functionality of the application. However, there are always areas for improvement, such as handling edge cases and optimizing performance. I am particularly satisfied with the modular design, which makes the code easy to maintain and extend.


TIL:
Today I learned how to effectively use Node.js and ESM modules to build a web scraper that automates a complex workflow. I also learned how to handle session cookies and analyze HTTP traffic to scrape dynamic content.
