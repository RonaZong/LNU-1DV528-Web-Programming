Learn more
------------------------

To learn more you can work with the exercise below.

* [`src/express/websocket`](../../../src/express/websocket/)

<!-- * [`src/express/socketio`](../../../src/express/socketio/) -->

Work through the exercise to get a live and running example on websockets together with an understanding on how to implement client side, server side and how to troubleshoot.

The communication framework SocketIO can also be used to implement a communication layer on top of websockets, check their [Get started with SocketIO](https://socket.io/get-started/chat), if you prefer SocketIO over Websocket.
