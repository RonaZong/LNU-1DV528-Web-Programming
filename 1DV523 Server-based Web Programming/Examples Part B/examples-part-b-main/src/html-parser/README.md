Parse HTML into a data structure
==============================

This example shows the basics of a HTML parser which can parse a HTML document into a datastructure.

You can read the documentation on the module "[Fast HTML Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-html-parser)".

The dependency is included in the `package.json` and you need to install it.

```
npm install
```

Now you can run the example program by:

```
node index.mjs
```

You see some output that is extracted from a HTML document. The module has several more options on how to extract details from and modify the document.
