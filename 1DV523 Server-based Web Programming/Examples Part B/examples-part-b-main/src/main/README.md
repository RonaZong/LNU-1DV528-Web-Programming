Main
==============================

Two different ways of writing a main program for a node application. Wrap in a main function or just write it on the outer level.

Start the programs by:

```
node index1
node index2
node index3
node index4
```

The second example is the preferred way together with separating your application code into ES-modules. There is (usually) no need to wrap the code into a main function since the code can be on the top level.

Investigate the code and see if you find something strange or it it is all clear.
