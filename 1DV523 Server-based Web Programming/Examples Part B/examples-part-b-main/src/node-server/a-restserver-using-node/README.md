A REST Server using Node HTTP Module
==============================

This example program shows how a simple REST server is built up using node. It shows a trivial front controller which uses a controller class to deal with the requests.

Start it by:

```
node index
# or
npx nodemon index
```

Then open a web browser and connect to it using: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

You can also use curl.

```
curl http://localhost:3000
```
