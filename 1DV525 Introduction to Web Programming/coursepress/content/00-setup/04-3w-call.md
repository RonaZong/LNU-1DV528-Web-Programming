title: "3-week call"
---

Three weeks into the course a "3 week call" is carried out to see if you are active to the course or not.

You can see in the "recommended study plan" when the "3 week call" is carried out.

The 3 week call does not apply to those who have re-registered to the course.

To show that you are active you must have done at least one commit to your GitLab repo for the first assignment. Then you are considered to be active in the course.

If you fail to do so, within the timeline of the 3 week call, you will be given a "avbrott"/"interruption" which is marked in Ladok and you will loose your registration to the course.
