About the course literature.

Online resources are available and detailed out in each part/lesson of the course and published on the course website.

During the course we will use The Mozilla Developers Network as a guide and reference. You can see an overview of the content at "[Web technology for developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)".

The author Dr. Axel Rauschmayer has a [set of JavaScript online books](https://exploringjs.com/) that are most valuable for anyone learning JavaScript. My recommendation to a programmer who knows how to program is to start with the book "[JavaScript for impatient programmers](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/index.html)".

The free online book "[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)" provides in insight into programming in general and JavaScript in particular.
