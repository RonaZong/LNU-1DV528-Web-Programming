Details about how the course is structured, its learning environment, tutoring activities and how to get help from your teacher.



Course structure
-------------------------

The execution of the course is divided into parts where each part have lectures/lessons (L) which introduce course topics, exercises (E) where the student can train and practice on the topics and assignments (A) where the student perform tasks and submit the work for grading to show they learnt the topics.



Learning environment
--------------------------

The course material will be distributed through CoursePress, which is known as the [website for the course](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/introduction-to-web-programming/).

Exercises and assignments will be provided from GitLab. Assignments should be submitted to GitLab.



Tutoring
--------------------------

**NOTE** that planning and tutoring of this course round is subject to Corona recommendations from the university and some parts of the course might be held online.

Teachers will have lectures and lessons on site at campus Växjö and/or online through Zoom.

Teacher assistants will be present on tutoring lectures at campus Växjö and/or online using Slack.

Pre-recorder video material and recorded lessons from previous course rounds will be used to present and enhance course topics.



Slack
--------------------------

First and foremost we recommend to ask questions in our slack-channel #1dv525-webprogramming. This is thee preferred way.

Do feel free to answer your fellow students questions, that provides a nice environment in the course.

_If your question is purly about HTML or CSS you can use the channel #topic-html_css or if you have a general javascript question you can use #topic-javascript._

Send private messages to the course management only if your question is of private nature.

We will also use slack to make video/screensharing calls. To use this please install the Slack client available for Mac OS, Windows and Linux.



Zoom
--------------------------

We might use Zoom for online lectures. You should install the Zoom client on your desktop.

These events will be recorded and published to a "secret-link" playlist on YouTube. The playlist link is only shared within the course but it is public for all who gets hold of it.

If you care about your anonymity you should mute your cam and rename your Zoom account name, during the recording phase of the lectures. The recording is shut off after the lecture and the questions and answer part is not recorded.



Mail
--------------------------

We prefer Slack as the first option to get in touch with the teacher.

Use email to get in contact with the course management related to issues or questions of private or course administrative nature.
