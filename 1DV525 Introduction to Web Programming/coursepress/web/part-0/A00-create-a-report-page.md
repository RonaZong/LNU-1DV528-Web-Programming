<!--
A01 - Build a website
===========================
-->


This is how to get going with the course, to verify that you have all essentials in place and to verify that you can use them. Later assignments will build upon this assignment, so save the results in a safe place.

The objective is to learn how to use Git and GitLab and you will create a small website where you will write reports from the assignments all through the course.

You will touch upon the course topics like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As an extra assignment, try to make an appealing report page, to the best of your capacity. You will continue to work with this website all through the course so you can also improve it later on.



Grading
------------------------

This assignment is graded U, Ux or G. You need to perform it since you will use it all throughout the course.



Preconditions
------------------------

You have checked out the general information on the course.

You have seen the course introduction.

You have installed the lab environment.

You have access to the course environment on GitLab.



Prepare
------------------------

If you are new to Git, you might want to work through the document "[Work with Git](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/introduction-to-web-programming/part-0-introduction-and-prepare/work-with-git/)" to gain some basic knowledge on how to work with Git and Git repos.



Requirements
------------------------

These are the requirements to fullfill the assignment.

1. You have a git repo on GitLab named "a00-report-page", available below your lnu student acronym in the course at GitLab. Start of by cloning the repo to your computer ("xxx" is your lnu-username):

```
## Using https
git clone https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv525/student/xxx/a00-report-page.git

# Using ssh
git clone git@gitlab.lnu.se:1dv525/student/xxx/a00-report-page.git
```

1. You are now ready to start creating your own report website for the course. The repo has a `README.md` that contains the details on what to do to pass the assignment.


<!--
Now you can pull our boilerplate repo into your repo:

git pull https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv525/exercise-boilerplate.git
-->



Requirements (extra)
------------------------

Do these if you have the will, time and energy. They may enhance your learning of the course topics.

1. Do you have a live webserver out there? Set up this website on it and make it public on the web.



Submission
------------------------

This is how to submit this assignment.

1. Update your report-page through the page `web/report.html` and answer the following questions. Write freely with 15 to 30 sentences of text.

    1. Describe your computer development environment, what OS, what terminal you are using, how you are using Git (through terminal or GUI), what texteditor/IDE you work in and if you have any plugins you like.

    1. Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub/GitLab and/or Markdown?

    1. Have you ever created websites before?

    1. Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.

    1. What is your TIL for this course part?

1. Add a tag to the repo to show that you are done with the assigment. Use the version v0.9.0 (or just 0.9.0). You may increase the last number if you do updates, like v0.9.1, v0.9.2 and so on. We'll save v1.0.0 for the next assignment.

1. Ensure you have committed and pushed all your changes, including the tags, to your GitLab repo.

1. Add an issue to the assignmentrepo if you have any question to the teacher. The teacher will check your issues during grading the assignment.

What is a TIL? TIL is an acronym for "Today I Learned" which playfully indicates that there are always new things to learn, every day. You usually pick up things you have learned and where you might have hiked to a little extra about its usefulness or simplicity, or it was just a new lesson for the day that you want to note.
