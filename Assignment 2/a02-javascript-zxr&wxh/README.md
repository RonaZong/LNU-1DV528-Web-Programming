# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

### Solution:
The index.html is a user login page and after user entering the nickname, the page will change to quiz.html.

### Download Instruction:
User use git bash in the "a02-javascript" folder, then type "npm run build" and "npm start".

### Rule:
Enter your nickname to start the quiz, you have 10 seconds for each quiz. If you got any question wrong, you will have to restart the quiz. If you exceed 10 seconds while answering one question, you will have to restart the quiz as well. After you get all the questions correctly, you will get all your time used for each question.
