## Before you start
Make sure you have watched the introductory demos and resources:

* [Getting started (resource)](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/introduction-to-web-programming/getting-started/)

## Getting started

Starting out with the exercises:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/329IAoTGrsg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Exercises are not mandantory and will not be corrected by the corse management. However, you will have a better chance of doing the examination assignments in the course if you first do the exercises. We higly recommend you to complete as many exercises as possible.

You have a git repo on Github named "xx222yy-exercises" where xx222yy is your lnu-username. You can use this repo for the exercises in the course. Start of by cloning the repo to your computer:
* `git clone https://github.com/1dv525/xx222yy-exercise.git`

Now you can pull our boilerplate repo into your repo:
* `git pull https://github.com/1dv525/exercise-boilerplate.git`

You are now ready to start with the exercises.

## The exercises

The exercises are devided in to seperate levels, A, B and C where C is the most difficult level. You should always strive to complete at least level A and B.

1. Add the exercise/exercises you want to work on by doing a 
 * `git subtree add --prefix={reponame} --squash {link to repo} master`. For example, to start with "tiny-tunes do": 
 * `git subtree add --prefix=tiny-tunes --squash https://github.com/CS-LNU-Learning-Objects/exercise-tiny-tunes.git master`
2. Navigate to the folder created. `cd tiny-tunes`
3. Do a `npm install` to install the exercise dependencies. 
2. Do `npm start`. The following will happen:
  * A process will start watching files in the folder `src/` for changes. When a change is detected the file will be "compiled" in to a virtual file called "build.js". A web server is started which will serve your browser with the resources needed.
3. Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to locate the application.

You should have multiple terminals open at the same time. One running the `npm start` and watching files and one terminal to do tasks like committing and pushing to GitHub. 

### ESM Modules
An important note regarding `require`. Since 2018 we have shifted from using "node modules" using "require" to using Ecma script modules, ESM and the keyword `import`. Do not use require as I do in some of my examples, instead please use import. Make sure to look at my explenations in the lecture "L05 - Javascript and the browser".

## Local IDE
1. Start up your IDE (Visual Studio Code) and open a new project pointing to the exercise or your exercise-folder. 
2. Start editing your site in the `src`-folder. When you save a change look terminal watching your files. You should see that the files are rebuilt. 
3. The webpage at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) should be automaticly reloaded. If not, refresh the browser.
4. When you debug your application you should to this in the browser, not in the IDE. A simple method is to write `debugger` in your js-source code where you want to stop the debugger and refresh the browser. Sourcemapping will make sure that linenumbers in the compiled-code matches your local version.
