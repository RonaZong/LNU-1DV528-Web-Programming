title: "A03 - JavaScript SPA"
---

This examination will focus on building a single page application with chat integration against a web socket server. The backend (server-side code) of this assignment will be given and your job is to write the client-side code.

In this examination assignment you are supposed to build what we call a "Personal Web Desktop" (PWD). First of all, have a look at this recording to get a better view of the assignment.
