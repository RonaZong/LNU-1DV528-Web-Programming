Course evaluation end feedback
-------------------------
-->

THis is a note about course evaluation and feedback to the teacher team.

If you feel that something is wrong or missing, start by letting the teacher know about it. Always communicate your concerns to the closest teacher, or the course responsible teacher.

The teacher team collects feedback during the course from loose comments on lessons, discussions with studentens, discussions within the teacher team and from observations in the course and from written feedback in reports from the assignments.

The responsible teacher collects some own thoughts on [improvements in an issue on the course repo](https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv525/content/CoursePress/-/issues/1).

You can provide additional feedback as [new issues on the course repo](https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv525/content/CoursePress/-/issues). Feel free to report improvements in course documentation or suggestions on how to improve the course in general.

An anonymous course evaluation is carried out at the end of the course.

The responsible teacher collects all feedback and summarises it in a document, after the course is done. The result is communicated to the students and made available to future students.
