    * Markdown: Markdown is used all throughout the web for writing text that is displayed on websites, chat, forum, documentation and frequently used in git repos. Read briefly through the document [Markdown: Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

    * GitLab has its own extension to Markdown, explained in "[GitLab Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html)".
