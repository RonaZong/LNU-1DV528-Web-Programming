### Startup

These are the requirements to fullfill the assignment.

1. You have a git repo on GitLab named "a01-website", available below your lnu student acronym in the course at GitLab. Start of by cloning the repo to your computer ("xxx" is your lnu-username):

```
# Using ssh
git clone git@gitlab.lnu.se:1dv525/student/xxx/a01-website.git
```

1. The repo has a `README.md` written in Markdown, open it up and add text describing the assignment and add a url to the page on CoursePress that formulates the requirements for the assignment. Do also add a representative image for the assignment.

1. Create a directory `web/`, here you shall save all your resources for the website.

1. Save the images in the directory `web/img/`. Use only low caps, to avoid mixing caps and getting into trouble on Mac/Unix.

1. Save your stylesheets in the directory `web/css/`.

1. Create a favicon image and use it on all pages.

(it is enough to stretch the width of your site, it might be a bit harder to stretch the browser width since it enforces you to have a certain HTML structure to support that)

1. Add another image to the background of the main section. Add some text ontop of it.



#### Normalize and typography

Change the style for 5 (or more) items in the text. The style does not need to be "nice" or "good", just change it and feel free to play around with style and textelements.

### JavaScript

<!-- task with form, submit button, enter creditcard and validate it -->

1. Add a page `javascript.html`.

1. Add your JavaScript code into one file `js/main.js` and include it into the web page. You may create more JavaScript files if needed if you feel a need to separate your code into different files.

1. With JavaScript, create an array with a wordlist with the words of your choice, use at least twenty words.

1. The web page should contain a button (and some instructions in text). When you press the button a randomized word, from the wordlist, should be displayed in the web page.

1. Show the word in upper case and in lower case, show how many characters the word has and count the number of vowels and consonants in the word.

1. Add an input field where the user can write a character that is read when the button is pressed. Check if the character is within the word and then show YES/NO to the user. It is a bit of a guessing game, the user guesses a character, you randomize a word and checks if the character is within that word and displays it to the user.

1. The character may exist in more than one place in the word (intelligent has two i:s in it) so do also display how many hits the character has and their position in the string.

1. Do organise your code in functions.



Requirements (extra)
------------------------

Do these if you have the will, time and energy. They may enhance your learning of the course topics.
