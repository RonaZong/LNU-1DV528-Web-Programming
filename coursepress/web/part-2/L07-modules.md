The session for L07 and L08 was combined in a 2 hour lecture held on Zoom. An example repo was used with code samples and a slide presentation was held. There were 2 recordings of 50 + 48 minutes.

In L07 Mikael talks about A02 part 2 and shows how to build JavaScript applications using Snowpack and how to create ES modules and ES6 classes.

In L08 Mikael shows how to do requests to a REST server and deal with the responses. It deals with the Fetch API, asynchronous programming and JSON.

The videos L07 and L08 are found in [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEtyhUSKTK3j1CnTUOZir50aN58GGQ7m6).
