## Content

Lecture L09 "SPA technologies and Web APIs" deals with what the SPA architecture is all about and how it relates to other non-SPA techniques to build websites. We will also review some of the Web APIs that are closely related to SPA techniques.



## Resources

The session for L09 and L10 was combined in a 2 hour lecture held on Zoom. An example repo was used with code samples and a slide presentation was held. There were 2 recordings of 60 + 36 minutes.

In L09 deals with the SPA architecture and some related Web APIs.

In L10 Mikael shows some examples on Web APIs for storage, drag & drop and websockets.
